IMPORTANT

If you are making a closed or lattice top (lattice is traditional for a Vlaai), you will need more flour. I made a lattice and used 125 gram of each of the two flours, for a total of 250 grams

FILLING

Do not use raw fruit in the Vlaai. The fruit will cook and burst and the liquid will ruin your pie. Cook the fruit separately and bind with a little sugar and corn starch and turn it into a kind of jam. Let it cool and use that for the filling.

NOW LET'S MAKE A VLAAI

Warm up the milk (not hot!) add the yeast, and stir to dissolve.

Put the salt in the mixing bowl first.

Sift the flour on top of the salt.

Make a dent in the flour and add the Butter, Sugar, Oil and Egg yoke.

Pour in the yeast/milk mix and knead (Mixer with dough hooks) into a supple dough.

Cover the dough and put in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes, of niet zo hastje jogentje!

Roll out the dough out to a 13 inch circle and cover the pan, taking off excess dough.

Spread the filling (fruit like strawberries, cherries, plums, peaches, apples, pears, gooseberries or apricots will work well) about 500 grams of fruit should be enough.
